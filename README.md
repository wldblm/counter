# counter

This is day 2 of my challenge. 
It's currently 19:42. 
I'm gonna take a shower and then get started with the project.
I'm gonna create a little counter (don't have that much time for a bigger project). 
It should be easy. 
Yesterday I had some issues with git since I haven't used it for a while, today I should be find.

[update]
It's 20:48.
I'v just finish to eat.
I give me till 22:00 to finish this project.

[update]
It's now 21:30.
Since it didn't take me that long I'm gonna add some easter eggs or something like this.
See you tomorrow.
